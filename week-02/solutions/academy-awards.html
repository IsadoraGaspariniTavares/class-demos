    <h1>Academy Awards</h1>

    <p>The Academy Awards, better known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit for the American film industry. The awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry in the United States.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people.</p>

    <p>The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($79 at 2020 prices). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927â€“28 period. The ceremony ran for 15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Academy Award of Merit</h3>

    <p>The best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated bronze on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34.3 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.856 kg), and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Actors</li>
      <li>Writers</li>
      <li>Directors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Naming</h3>

    <p>The Academy officially adopted the name "Oscar" for the trophies in 1939. However, the origin of the nickname is disputed.</p>

    <p>One biography of Bette Davis, who was a president of the Academy in 1941, claims she named the award after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson. A frequently mentioned originator is Margaret Herrick, the Academy executive director, who, when she first saw the award in 1931, said the statuette reminded her of "Uncle Oscar," a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce.</p>
